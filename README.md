# Cupertino Light

A minimal, light syntax theme for Atom.

Every color was deliberately chosen to reduce eye strain while still maintaing high readability. Unlike most light themes, this one is easy on the eyes as opposed to making you feel like your eyes are going to burn up and fall out of their sockets.

For Visual Studio Code, I like the [Alabaster](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonsky.theme-alabaster) syntax theme using the following modifications to match the colors in this theme:
